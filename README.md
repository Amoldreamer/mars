# Mars

Mars is the [Urán 2.0](https://github.com/kovacsur10/uran) unified information system for Eötvös Collegium. It's a complete 
rewrite, therefore comes under a new name and repository. Only a few resources are migrated from the Urán system.

## Architecture

Urán is a Laravel based application. For more information, see the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x).
